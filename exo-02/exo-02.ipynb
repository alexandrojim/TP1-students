    "## Markov Random Fields (MRFs) - Edge detection\n",
    "\n",
    "A Markov Random Field is a model used in the context of undirected graphical models. Instead of a sequence of states like in Markov processes, MRFs consider a set of variables (which can be organized, for instance, in a grid-like structure in image processing). The key property of an MRF is that a variable is conditionally independent of all other variables given its neighbors in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Differences with Markov Processes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nature of Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Markov processes usually describe the evolution of a system over time.\n",
    "    MRFs model dependencies among variables that might not necessarily have a temporal ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Graph Type:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Markov processes can be visualized with directed graphs (especially for discrete-time Markov chains).\n",
    "    MRFs are represented using undirected graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dependency:\n",
    "\n",
    "    In Markov processes, the next state's probability depends only on the current state.\n",
    "    In MRFs, a variable's probability distribution might depend on the states of its neighbors.\n",
