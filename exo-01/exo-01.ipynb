    "### Markov Processes:\n",
    "A Markov process (often referring specifically to a Markov chain when talking about discrete-time processes) is a mathematical model that undergoes transitions from one state to another within a finite or countable number of possible states. The key property of a Markov process is that the probability of transitioning to any particular state is dependent solely on the current state and time elapsed, and not on the sequence of states that preceded it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Memorylessness: The future state only depends on the current state and not the sequence of states that led to the current state.\n",
    "- Transition Probabilities: In a discrete-time Markov chain, these probabilities can be represented using a matrix, where the entry at row *i* and column *j* represents the probability of transitioning from state *i* to state *j*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The problem:\n",
    "We want to study the movement of a customer over a period of time among the different restaurants of a famous chain in town. We will use Markov processes to model the custumer's behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider there are 3 restaurants in the town part of the chain: Burger Joint, Pizza Place, and Sushi Bar. Over time, based on the preferences and options, a customer might decide to switch restaurants or stay at the current one."
